        while still functioning at its desired level. As the number of nominators
        grew, block times increased, and the network began experiencing some instability.
        In response, Polkadot has a limit on DOT nominations that will eliminate the
        smallest nominations (these will not receive rewards) to maintain network
        stability and normal block times. Developers have since dropped the minimum
        nomination amount from 200 to 35 DOT; therefore, users with less than 35 DOT
        staking are not receiving any rewards. Polkadot is still working on a permanent
        fix. In the meantime, stakers with less than 35 DOT can use exchange-based
        staking services, which pool user funds together and shouldn't lose any rewards

        for Increasing Validator Set\",\"assets\":[\"polkadot\"],\"details\":\"As
        of Jan. 20, 2021, Polkadot is operating with 300 validators. The network reached
        this number after DOT holders passed Referendum 9 to gradually increase the
        validator set once every epoch for about 100 epochs (ending on 300). The Polkadot
        team released a \\\"Performance Report\\\" that tracked standard network statistics,
        and the report said that network bandwidth the number of GrandPa messages
        increased alongside the validator set. While not unexpected, these changes
        will also increase the cost requirements of running a validator. In response,
        Polkadot's parachains team has suggested that the network should only use
        a subset of validators (around 50-200) each session to reach a consensus on
        parachain transactions. The selected validators within these subsets will
        receive the bulk of the rewards for a given session, but rewards should be
        relatively equal over time.\\n\\nThe Polkadot team also said that the validator
        set should remain relatively low and estimated that a reasonable number for
        the next gradual validator set increase is up to 500. Keeping this number
        low may not only help network stability and reward variation but could also
        lead to \\\"an earlier launch of parachains.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\",\"eventDate\":\"2021-01-20T00:00:00Z\",\"softDate\":\"\",\"status\":\"Completed\",\"category\":\"Project
